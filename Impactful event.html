    <h3>Biking</h3>
<p1>I used to have really bad anger issues and then i started riding bmx (i used to previously ride bikes just was never super into it). I started riding bmx and started getting really into it and learning tricks and stuff, then i started riding aboutb 12 miles everyday and it started getting pretty hard with such a small bike so i invested into a bigger bike and i started learning how to do wheelies and stuff then i started mountain biking and thats what ive been doing recently. overall riding bikes was a very impactful thing that happened to me because it made me a lot calmer and really helped me focus.
